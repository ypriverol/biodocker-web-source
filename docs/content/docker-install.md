By default, the standard Docker Toolbox installation:
  
- installs binaries for the Docker tools in /usr/local/bin
- makes these binaries available to all users
- installs VirtualBox; or updates any existing installation
- To change these defaults, press “Customize” or “Change Install Location.”
  
5- Press “Install” to perform the standard installation.

The system prompts you for your password.
