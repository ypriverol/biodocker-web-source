# BioDocker History

In 2012, Felipe Leprevost and Yasset Perez-Riverol started a formal an strong collaboration when both of them were doing the PhD in Brazil
and Cuba, respectively.

In 2014, they published a first manuscript of best practices to for bioinformatics software development:
[On best practices in the development of bioinformatics software](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2014.00199).

In 2013, [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software\)) became a more stable framework and rapidly grows in the IT community, 
amount developers, software engenders, etc. In 2015, we started BioDocker as a community-driven project to standardize the way we 
develop, deploy and use bioinformatics software. 

In 2015, two new developers become members of the project [Saulo Alves](https://github.com/sauloal) and 
[Björn Grüning](https://github.com/bgruening) (from Galaxy Team) moving forward the project into a community-driven
initiative. 

BioDocker has received an special attention from Mass-Spectrometry and Proteomics 
community. At the moment of writing (June 2016) BioDocker Provides more
than [20 ready to use containers](https://github.com/BioDocker/containers).
